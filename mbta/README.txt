COMP20-LAB8

The repo contains the files that compose the mbta site. To access the site,
open "index.html" using your web brower. The site displays a full screen map
with all the red line stations displayed as a marker connected by a red
polyline.

1) The files have been implemented correctly. There does not exist anything
that I was not properly able to implement.

2) Worked on this alone.

3) 3 hours were spent working on this lab.
