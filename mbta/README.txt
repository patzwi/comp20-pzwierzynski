COMP20-LAB10

The repo contains the files that compose the mbta site. To access the site,
open "index.html" using your web browser. The site displays a full screen map,
with all the red line stations displayed, as well as the users current location.
By clicking on a marker (station or user), an info window is displayed showing
some useful info.

1) The files have been implemented correctly. There does not exist anything
that I was not properly able to implement. No bonus objective was completed.

2) Worked on this alone.

3) 5 hours were spent working on this lab.
