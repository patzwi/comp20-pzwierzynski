COMP20 LAB7

The repo contains the files that compose the messages site. To access the
site, open the "index.html" file using your web browser. The site displays two
parsed json messages.

1) The javascript has been implemented correctly. There does not exist anything
that I was not properly able to implement.

2) Worked on this alone.

3) 1 hour was spent working on this lab.
