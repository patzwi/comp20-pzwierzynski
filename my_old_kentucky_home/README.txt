COMP20 LAB6

This repo contains the files that compose the lab6 site. To acces the site,
open the "index.html" file using your web browser. The site plays a video of
the song "My Old Kentucky Home", and displays the lyrics sang during specific
intervals in the video.

1) The javascript and stylesheet has been implemented correctly. There does not
