Patrick ZwierzynskiCOMP20 LAB5This repo contains the files to the lab 5 site. To access the site, open the “index.html” file using your web browser. The repo contains a larger comic, composed of 10 sections. Depending on the width of the browser window being used to display the site, a different section will be displayed. The stylesheet (responsive.css) outlines which sections are displayed at certain widths. The full comic (all sections) can be seen in the “software.png” file.1) The stylesheet has been implemented correctly. There does not exist anything that I was not properly able to implement.2) Worked on this alone.3) 1.5 hours were spent working on the project.
