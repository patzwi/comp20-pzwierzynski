This repo contains the file to the site containing the security report to the
app running server-vuln.js. To access the report, open up the "index.html" file
using your web browser.

1) The third security vulnerability was a bit difficult for me to find. Apart
from that, I believe everything else was properly documented.

2) Worked on this alone.

3) 6.5 hours were spent working on this report.
