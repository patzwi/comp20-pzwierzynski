  <h1 class="center">Security Assessment of server-vuln.js</h1>
  <p class="center">
    by Patrick Zwierzynski
  </p>
  <hr />

  <h2 class="center">Introduction</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
    The purpose of this assessment is to outline any potential security flaws
    within the provided server-vuln.js app. By visiting the default homepage
    <a target="_blank" href="http://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com/">here</a>
    the page should display a list of user "check-in" information, including
    login name, latitude and longitude coordinates, and time of check-in. This
    is all done via the app's three routes (two GET and one POST), which are
    used to recieve user check-in info from user requests as well as post all
    user check-in info as a response.
  </p>

  <h2 class="center">Methodology</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
    This assesment was performed via a two step process. The first of which was
    "black-box" testing, which involved setting up, running, and searching for
    vulnerabilities within the app without reviewing its source code. This was
    performed using the OWASP ZAP vulnerability scanner software. The second
    of which was "white-box" testing, which involved manually
    reviewing the source code and attacking anything that appeared particularly
    vulnerable. This was done using the "curl" command in the terminal. When
    scanning for vulnerabilities, a heroku site running a live version of server-vuln.js
    (<a target="_blank" href="http://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com/">http://defense-in-derpth.herokuapp.com/</a>)
    was used. Any curl tests were performed both locally and on the heroku site.
  </p>

  <h2 class="center">Abstract of Findings</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
    After performing both black-box and white-box testing, some vulnerabilities
    were found within the server-vuln web app. These issues are mainly a result
    of not checking the user input for correctness. While most of the data, such
    as the user longitude and latitude coordinates, is validated before being
    added to the database, other input data fields, such as the user login name,
    rely on user correctness, which leaves the database vulnerable to malicious
    data.
  </p>

  <h2 class="center">Issues Found</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h4 class="text-box">Cross Site Scripting (XSS)</h4>
      <ul class="text-box">
        <li>
          This issue was found on the '/sendLocation' POST route.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="color:red;">High Risk</span> as this vulnerability allows
          for a malicious user to run javascript/html code from the web app to
          potentially steal other users login names and locations. Can also run
          code to completely render site unusable.
        </li>
        <li>
          This issue was found in the code after the login user input data was
          requested. While the lat and lng input fields are properly validated,
          the input login field only checks if it is undefined. In addition to
          this, there was no check to filter out any characters that allow for
          javascript/html code to be executed. The code below shows where the vulnerability exists: <br />
          <img src="images/XSS_1.png" style="max-width:100%" />
        </li>
        <li>
          By inputting the following curl command: <br />
          <img src="images/XSS_3.png" style="max-width:100%" /> <br />
          I was able to "hide" all the check-in entries before me, display an invalid
          check-in entry, and automatically play a youtube video in the background
          that the user is unable to turn off (not that they would want to turn off
          the awesome jams :D). See the image below for proof: <br />
          <img src="images/XSS_2.png" style="max-width:100%" />
        </li>
        <li>
          This issue can be easily fixed by creating a "filter" within the code that removes
          any special characters from the login input. An example of this is:
          <br />
          <code>
            ... <br />
            var login = request.body.login; <br />
            login = login.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); <br />
            ...
          </br/> <br /> <br />
          </code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4 class="text-box">Injection</h4>
      <ul class="text-box">
        <li>
          This issue was found on the '/checkins.json' GET route.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="color:red;">High Risk</span> as this vulnerability allows
          for a malicious user to access login data that is not authorized.
        </li>
        <li>
          This issue was found in the code after the login user input data was
          requested. After this data was requested, it was only checked to see
          if the data was undefined or null, which leaves it vulnerable to an
          injection attack. The code below shows where the vulnerability exists:
          <br />
          <img src="images/Injection3.png" style="max-width:100%" />
        </li>
        <li>
          Normally, the /checkins.json route should display the following site: <br />
          <img src="images/Injection1.png" style="max-width:100%" /> <br />
          Using a query string with the $ne (not equal) operator, I was able to
          request all the current data being stored in the database. This query
          string displays all data whose "login" name is not equal to 0. See the
          image below for proof: <br />
          <img src="images/Injection2.png" style="max-width:100%" />
        </li>
        <li>
          This issue can alse be easily fixed by creating a "filter" within the
          code that removes any special characters from the login input. More
          specifically, the "$" character is to be removed. An example of this
          is:
          <br />
          <code>
            ... <br />
            var loginEntry = request.body.login; <br />
            loginEntry = loginEntry.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, ''); <br />
            ...
          <br/> <br/> <br />
          </code>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <h4 class="text-box">X-Frame Options Header Not Set</h4>
      <ul class="text-box">
        <li>
          This issue was found on the '/' GET route.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span style="color:#d3bc37;">Medium-Low Risk</span> as this vulnerability
          does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks, in which "a web user
          can be tricked into clicking on something different from what the user
          perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing
          confidential information or taking control of their computer"
          (<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
          This issue was found during black-box testing using the OWASP ZAP
          scanner of the defense-in-derpth heroku site. The following image
          below shows the scanner output: <br />
          <img src="images/ClickJacking1.png" style="max-width:100%" />
        </li>
        <li>
          The scanner offers the following solution to fix the issue:
          <br />
          <img src="images/ClickJacking2.png" style="max-width:100%" />
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="center">Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="text-box">
      The vulnerabilities in the server-vuln.js file leave the web app exposed
      to many security issues, ranging from rendering the app completely unusable
      to exposing potentially confidential and sensitive user information.
      The issues themselves (at least the two high risk vulnerabilities) appear
      easy to implement and fix. My recommendation would be to shut down the app
      immediately and fix the changes quickly before any further damage can be
      done.
